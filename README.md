This repository is the source code for my site - http://code-utils.appspot.com/

Code-Utils is a problem classifier for Codechef. You can search problems by their name, code, author and tags. Additionaly, logged in users can rate, mark as favourite and add tags to problems they have solved. You can also mark unsolved problems as To-Do. Also, it is possible to compare any two different users on Codechef.
